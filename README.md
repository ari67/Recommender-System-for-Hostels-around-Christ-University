The PG/Hostel Recommendation System uses a combination of content-based and hybrid-based recommendation techniques to generate personalized recommendations.

The system works by collecting data about paying guest accommodations and user preferences, which are then analyzed and processed to generate recommendations. This process involves natural language processing techniques to extract relevant features from the accommodation descriptions, such as keywords and topics, which are then used in the content-based recommendation system. It uses the content-based recommendation system to analyze the textual descriptions of the accommodations to recommend similar accommodations that match the student's preferences. In addition, the system uses demographic information such as gender and place of origin to provide more personalized recommendations. The demographic information is used to filter the recommendations based on the student's preferences. For example, if a female student is searching for paying guest accommodation, the system will only recommend accommodations that are safe and suitable for female students.
